In this paper, we study the deadlock problem in lossless network, and try to answer
this question: how can we avoid deadlock even if there is cyclic buffer dependency in
the network? We demonstrate a few case studies in which deadlock occurrence depends on
factors other than cyclic buffer dependency. In light of these examples, we discuss 
potential deadlock mitigation mechanisms including TTL-based, rate limiting and reducing
PFC propagation. We plan to further study the 
necessary and sufficient conditions for deadlock, derive analysis tools that quickly determine
deadlock occurrence without running packet-level simulation, and develop and compare
different deadlock mitigation mechanisms in future work.
