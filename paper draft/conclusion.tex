In this paper, we study the problem of deadlock in datacenter network.  We
demonstrate a few case studies in which deadlock formation depends on factors
other than cyclic buffer dependency. In light of these examples, we discuss
potential deadlock mitigation mechanisms including TTL-based schemes, rate
limiting and reducing PFC propagation.
