In this paper, we studied the problem of deadlock in datacenter networks.  We
showed that cyclic buffer dependency is a {\em necessary} by not {\em
sufficient} condition for deadlock formation. We are unable to fully characterize
teh sufficient conditions, but using insights gained from a few examples, we
discussed potential deadlock mitigation mechanisms including TTL-based schemes,
rate limiting and reducing PFC propagation.
