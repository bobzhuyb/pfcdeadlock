\abstract{
Driven by the need for ultra-low latency, high throughput and low CPU overhead,
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is being deployed by many cloud providers.
To deploy RDMA in Ethernet networks, Priority Flow Control (PFC) must be
used. PFC, however, makes Ethernet networks prone to deadlocks. Prior work on
deadlock avoidance has focused on {\em necessary} condition for deadlock
formation, which leads to rather onerous and expensive solutions for deadlock
avoidance. In this paper, we investigate {\em sufficient} conditions for
deadlock formation, conjecturing that avoiding {\em sufficient} conditions might
be less onerous.
