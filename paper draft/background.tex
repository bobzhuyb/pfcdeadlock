\section{Deadlock in RDMA networks}

\para{RDMA networks rely on PFC.}

\para{PFC may lead to deadlock, if forming a cycle of PFC-paused links.}

\para{Achieving deadlock-free routing has high price, and may not even be viable.} 
It limits the choice of topology. Upon bugs or misconfiguration, deadlock-free routing
configuration may still have deadlock issues.
