\para{RDMA in datacenters.} RDMA has wide applications~\cite{farm} and is deployed inside 
modern datacenters~\cite{timely,dcqcn,rdmascale}. The current deployment is based on
RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet), which relies on PFC creating a lossless Ethernet.
Recent works~\cite{timely,dcqcn} discuss the transport congestion control protocols. However,
how to prevent PFC deadlock from happening in the lossless Ethernet has been pointed out 
but not addressed. This work aims to get deeper understanding on deadlock and possible mitigations.

\para{Deadlock-free routing.} Avoiding deadlock in lossless networks is not a new research 
topic. Previous research literatures~\cite{tcpbolt,karol2003prevention} focus on deadlock-free routing, 
{\em i.e.,} with any traffic matrix, packet formats or flow rates, it is guaranteed that deadlock 
does not occur. Main approaches including ensuring shortest-path tree-based routing, and 
trying to avoid routing loops.
