In this paper we discuss a problem that is quite (c)old, albeit one that has
re-emerged in a new context, and admit that we have no idea how to solve it
completely. Our hope is to draw the community's attention to this problem, and
re-ignite research in this area.

The problem is deadlock formation in lossless networks.

Driven by the need for ultra-low latency, high throughput and low CPU overhead,
major cloud service providers are deploying Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) in
their datacenter networks~\cite{dcqcn,timely}. Among the
available RDMA technologies,  RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)~\cite{roce} is
a promising one as it is compatible with current IP and Ethernet based
datacenter networks.

The deployment of RoCE requires Priority-based Flow Control (PFC)~\cite{pfc} to
provide a lossless L2 network. With PFC, packet loss can be avoided by letting a
switch pause its immediate upstream device before buffer overflow occurs.
However, PFC can cause deadlock problem. Deadlock refers to a
standstill situation: there is a {\em Cyclic Buffer Dependency} (CBD) among a set of
switches. Each switch in the cycle holds all the buffer needed by its upstream
switch, and meanwhile is waiting for its downstream switch to release some
buffer and resume its packet transmission. A simple scenario is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:deadlock_example}.

It is easy to see that when deadlock occurs, no switch in the cycle can proceed. Further, throughput of the whole network
or part of the network will go to zero due to the backpressure
effect of PFC pause.

It is often believed that such deadlocks cannot occur in clos-structured
datacenter networks, since a loop cannot form in such networks with valley-free
routing~\cite{dcqcn}.  \revise{However, Guo et al.~\cite{rdmascale} has shown
that deadlocks can indeed occur in such network.} We now believe that deadlocks
can also occur when transient loops form in clos structured networks. In our
datacenters, these can happen as BGP\footnote{In our datacenters, we use BGP for
routing, with each switch being a private AS.} re-routes around link failures.
In SDN-based datacenters, transient loops can occur during
updates~\cite{dionysus}. While loops may be transient, the deadlocks caused by
them are not. Deadlocks do not automatically break even after the problems
(misconfiguration, failures/updates, etc.) that cause them have been fixed.

Hence some mechanism for handling the deadlock problem must be used when
deploying RDMA in datacenter networks.  These mechanisms fall in two broad
categories: 

{\em Reactive} mechanisms/systems detect that a deadlock has formed, and then
try to break it by resetting links/ports/hosts etc.  These mechanisms are
inelegant, disruptive, and should be used only as a last resort.  We do not
consider them further in this paper.  

{\em Proactive} deadlock prevention is a more principled approach to this
problem. Prior work on deadlock prevention can be classified into two
categories including 1) \textit{Routing restriction-based
approach}~\cite{tcpbolt,flich2012survey}. The idea of this approach is to ensure
that no CBD exists in the network by limiting the routing
paths used in each priority class;  2) \textit{buffer management (structured
buffer pool) based approach}~\cite{gerla1980flow,karol2003prevention}. This
approach divides switch buffer into several buffer classes. A packet is allowed
to access more buffer classes as it travels greater distance in the network. It
can be proved that as long as the number of buffer classes is no smaller than
the hop count of the longest routing path, there will be no CBD.

%Both these approaches to deadlock prevention have some important drawbacks.
%Approaches based on routing restriction usually waste link bandwidth and limit
%throughput performance, while buffer management based approach introduces
%non-trivial deployment complexity. These drawbacks can be viewed as the cost of
%eliminating cyclic buffer dependency in the network. While avoiding cycle buffer
%dependency gurantees a deadlock-free network, it may not be always feasible to
%pay these costs.

Both categories of approaches to deadlock prevention have some important
drawbacks.  Using routing restrictions to prevent deadlocks usually wastes link
bandwidth and limits throughput performance. Preventing deadlocks via buffer
management may require a lot of priority classes and switch buffer for networks
of large diameters, rendering them impractical: today's commodity switches with
shallow buffer can support at most 2 lossless traffic classes~\cite{rdmascale}.

As noted earlier, all these mechanisms share a commonality: they seek to
eliminate CBD.  Thus, the drawbacks described above can be
viewed as the cost of eliminating CBD in the network. While
avoiding cycle buffer dependency guarantees a deadlock-free network, it may not
be always feasible to pay these costs.

Thus, we take step back and ask: Is CBD a necessary
condition for deadlock formation, or is it a sufficient condition? If it is only
a {\em necessary} condition, can we focus on {\em sufficient} conditions, and
guarantee deadlock freedom, without  eliminating CBD?

To answer the above questions, we studied several representative deadlock cases.
First, we find that CBD is just a necessary condition for
deadlock. In some sense, this is trivially true: if no flow is sending any data,
there will obviously be no deadlock, regardless of CBD.
However, there are also several non-trivial cases where CBD
is met, all flows are active, but there is no deadlock.  Second, we find that
even if all the links in a switch cycle are paused simultaneously, deadlock may
still not occur.  These findings indicate that prior solutions are {\em too}
conservative.

So, in this paper, we shall try to understand the {\em sufficient} conditions
for deadlock formation, which we conjecture to be far easier to ameliorate than
the {\em necessary} conditions. As mentioned earlier, we do not yet have a
precise characterization of the sufficient conditions. Yet, we have made some
headway, which allows us to sketch a few possible solutions to the problem.
