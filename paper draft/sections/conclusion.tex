%In this paper, we have designed and implemented \sys, a simple yet effective routing solution that enables explicit path control by harnessing IP tables of commodity switches.

\sys is motivated by the need for explicit path control in DCN applications. At its very core, \sys uses a path ID to identify an end-to-end path, and pre-installs all the desired path IDs between any s-d pairs into IP LPM tables of commodity switches using a two-step compression algorithm. Through extensive evaluation and implementation, we show that \sys is scalable and easy to implement with existing commodity switches. Finally, we used testbed experiments to show that \sys can directly benefit many popular DCN applications.


%Motivated by the need for explicit path control in emerging data center applications, we designed and implemented \sys, a simple yet powerful routing solution that enables explicit path control by harnessing the cheap but much larger IP table instead of using OpenFlow. At its very core, \sys builds on a simple concept of path ID to express an end-to-end path, a bold idea of pre-installing all desired paths between any source-destination pairs into IP tables, and a novel algorithm of paths to routing entries compression that translates this bold idea into practical. Through extensive evaluation and implementation, we demonstrate that \sys is highly scalable, easy to implement, and importantly, can be incorporated into applications to directly benefit them. Finally, we will make \sys implementation publicly available to the community.

%We have designed, implemented, and evaluated \sys, a generic Routing over eXplicit paths for DCNs.
%\sys introduces a fundamental concept of path ID to explicitly identify the end-to-end routing path on arbitrary DCNs.
%By developing a novel two-step compression approach, \sys can express all desired paths between any source-destination pairs using IP prefix based routing tables of commodity switches. By enforcing explicit control, \sys can readily serve as a routing primitive to fully take advantage of multi-paths for various DCN technologies spread from fine-grained traffic engineering to network virtualization.
%\sys possesses the spirit of SDN. By statically configuring the IP prefix based routing tables of commodity switches, \sys avoids the constraints of limited OpenFlow entries. \sys is more scalable and less error-prone than existing designs that require dynamic configuration using OpenFlow entries.
%Our intensive simulations over various large-scale DCNs have shown \sys's scalability and expressiveness; And our implementation and experiments over a small-scale $54$-server Fattree testbed have demonstrated \sys's feasibility.
