\abstract{
Many data center network (DCN) applications require explicit routing path control over the underlying topologies. This paper introduces \sys, a simple, practical and readily-deployable way to implement explicit path control, using existing commodity switches. At its core, \sys explicitly identifies an end-to-end path with a path ID and leverages a two-step compression algorithm to pre-install all the desired paths into IP TCAM tables of commodity switches. Our evaluation and implementation show that \sys scales to large DCNs and is readily-deployable. Furthermore, on our testbed, we integrate \sys into four applications to showcase its utility.

%We use 5 experiments to showcase that RoX can directly benefit many popular applications.

%To this end, we propose \sys, Routing over eXplicit paths for commodity data center networks (DCNs). At its core, \sys use a path ID to express an end-to-end path, and then leverages an effective two-step compression algorithm to pre-install all desired multiple paths between any s-d pairs into IP tables. We evaluate \sys on various large DCNs to show its scalability, and implement \sys with commodity switches to show its deployability. Especially, we incorporate \sys into 5 real applications and show that it directly benefits all of them, \ie, from providing precise bandwidth required by provisioned IOPS to reducing shuffle time of Map-reduce by 3$\times$ over ECMP.

%Especially, we implement \sys into 5 representative applications (from provisioned IOPS to Map-reduce) to show that \sys can directly benefit them.


%Our evaluation on a variety of large DCNs with millions of nodes show \sys's expressiveness and scalability -- it can express tens of billions of paths using only 36K of routing entries. Our implementation and experiments on a $54$-server Fattree demonstrate \sys's feasibility -- it can be readily implemented with existing switch hardware, provides explicit path control at scale while incurring much less overhead than OpenFlow.

%We also believe that \sys is a small yet important step towards SDN paradigm.
