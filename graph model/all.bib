                  updating their strategies at different frequencies,
                  play tends toward the Stackelberg outcome which
                  favors the slower player. Convergence is
                  significantly more robust for a "serial cost
                  sharing" game, which satisfies a stronger solution
                  concept of overwhelmed solvability. As the number of
                  players grows, this improved convergence tends to
                  diminish, seemingly driven by frequent and highly
                  structured experimentation by players leading to a
                  cascading effect in which experimentation by one
                  player induces experimentation by others. These
                  results have implications both for traditional
                  oligopoly competition and for a wide variety of
                  strategic situations arising on the Internet}

                  system, we have proposed a new QoS monitoring
                  technique, Change-of-Measure based Passive/Active
                  Monitoring (CoMPACT Monitor), which is based on
                  change-of-measure framework and is an active
                  measurement transformed by using passively monitored
                  data. This technique enables us to measure detailed
                  QoS information for individual users, applications,
                  and organizations, in a scalable and lightweight
                  manner. In this paper, we present the mathematical
                  foundation of CoMPACT Monitor. In addition, we show
                  its characteristics through simulations in terms of
                  typical implementation issues for inferring the
                  delay distributions. The results show that CoMPACT
                  Monitor gives accurate QoS estimations with only a
                  small amount of extra traffic for active

                  protocol and application agnostic in order to be as
                  general as possible. The proposed solution is to
                  model the traffic at the flow level by a Poisson
                  shot-noise process. In our model, a flow is a
                  generic notion that must be able to capture the
                  characteristics of any kind of data stream. We
                  analyze the accuracy of the model with real traffic
                  traces collected on the Sprint IP backbone
                  network. Despite its simplicity, our model provides
                  a good approximation of the real traffic observed in
                  the backbone and of its variation. Finally, we
                  discuss three applications of our model to network
                  design and management.}

                  and evaluate traffic granularity levels that are
                  attractive for improving the poor load balancing
                  that our study reveals. The data used in this study
                  was collected at a major POP in a commercial Tier-1
                  IP backbone. In the first part of this paper we ask
                  two questions. What is the traffic demand between a
                  pair of POPs in the backbone? How stable is this
                  demand? We develop a methodology that combines
                  packet-level traces from access links in the POP and
                  BGP routing information to build components of
                  POP-to-POP traffic matrices. Our analysis shows that
                  the geographic spread of traffic across egress POPs
                  is far from uniform. In addition, we find that the
                  time of day behaviors for different POPs and
                  different access links also exhibit a high degree of
                  heterogeneity. In the second part of this work, we
                  examine commercial routing practices to assess how
                  these demands are routed through the backbone. We
                  find that traffic between a pair of POPs is
                  engineered to be restricted to a few paths and that
                  this contributes to widely varying link utilization
                  levels. The natural question that follows from these
                  findings is whether or not there is a better way to
                  spread the traffic across backbone paths. We
                  identify traffic aggregates based on destination
                  address prefixes and find that this set of criteria
                  isolates a few aggregates that account for an
                  overwhelmingly large portion of inter-POP
                  traffic. We demonstrate that these aggregates
                  exhibit stability throughout the day on perhour time
                  scales, and thus form a natural basis for splitting
                  traffic over multiple paths to improve load
                  balancing.}

                  particularly for applications like environmental
                  monitoring of water and soil, requires that these
                  nodes be very small, light, untethered and
                  unobtrusive. The problem of localization, i.e.,
                  determining where a given node is physically located
                  in a network is a challenging one, and yet extremely

                  communications capabilities of these devices. A
                  fixed number of reference points in the network with
                  overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic
                  beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity
                  metric, that is more robust to environmental
                  vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of
                  these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to
                  the centroid of their proximate reference
                  points. The accuracy of localization is then
                  dependent on the separation distance between two
                  adjacent reference points and the transmission range
                  of these reference points. Initial experimental
                  results show that the accuracy for 90\% of our data
                  points is within one-third of the separation
                  distance. However future work is needed to extend
                  the technique to more cluttered environments.},

  annote =   {We analyze a routing scheme for a broad class of
                  networks which converges (in the Cesaro sense) with
                  probability one to the set of approximate
                  Cesaro-Wardrop equilibria, an extension of the
                  notion of a Wardrop equilibrium. The network model
                  allows for wireline networks where delays are caused
                  by flows on links, as well as wireless networks, a
                  primary motivation for us, where delays are caused
                  by other flows in the vicinity of nodes. The routing
                  algorithm is distributed, using only the local
                  information about observed delays by the nodes, and
                  is moreover impervious to clock offsets at
                  nodes. The scheme is also fully asynchronous, since
                  different iterates have their own counters and the
                  orders of packets and their acknowledgments may be
                  scrambled. Finally, the scheme is adaptive to the
                  traffic patterns in the network. The demonstration of
                  convergence in a fully dynamic context involves the
                  treatment of two-time scale distributed asynchronous
                  stochastic iterations. Using an ODE approach, the
                  invariant measures are identified. Due to a
                  randomization feature in the algorithm, a direct
                  stochastic analysis shows that the algorithm avoids
                  non-Wardrop equilibria. Finally, some comments on
                  the existence, uniqueness, stability, and other
                  properties of Wardrop equilibria are made.},

                  traffic information systems in which the up-link
                  bandwidth is very limited, a server broadcasts data
                  files in a round-robin manner. The data files are
                  provided by different providers and are accessed by
                  many clients. The providers are independent and
                  therefore files may share information. The clients
                  who access these files may have different patterns
                  of access. Some clients may wish to access more than
                  one file at a time in any order, some clients may
                  access one file out of of several files, and some
                  clients may wish to access a second file only after
                  accessing another file. The goal of the server is to
                  order the files in a way that minimizes the access
                  time of the clients given some a-priori knowledge of
                  their access patterns. This paper introduces a
                  clients-providers-servers model that better
                  represents certain environments than the traditional
                  clients-servers model. Then, we show that a random
                  order of the data files performs well independent of
                  the specific access pattern. Our main technical
                  contribution is showing how to de-randomize the
                  randomized algorithm that is based on selecting a
                  random order. The resulting algorithm is a
                  polynomial time deterministic algorithm that finds
                  an order that achieves the bounds of the random
                  order. }

  abstract =     {RMTP-II protocol entities can be divided into
                  several roles. Sender (SN), Top node (TN),
                  Designated receiver (DR), and receiver (RN). By this
                  talk, they assume DR, and TN are trusted.The talk
                  then went on about security concern for each type of
                  attacks. First is DOS attack. It can be DOS to a
                  specific receiver. It will result in corruption of
                  control state. It can also overload the network by
                  spurious retransmission request, or sender
                  transmitting too fast, or improperly scoped
                  multicast packet. It can also exhaust CPU by
                  flooding group membership changes. It can also
                  exhaust memory by refusal to ACK packets. The
                  suggestion for the DOS prevention proposed are:
                  extends IPSec to provide light weight group
                  authentication by giving different keys depending on
                  roles, and also maybe for different trust
                  domains. For example one key for all DR and TN in
                  the same trust domain, one key for each sender, one
                  key for all receivers. However it still allows valid
                  senders and receivers access to DoS attacks, if they
                  are malicious. Also it still allow brute force DoS
                  attacks. The brute force attack can only be solved
                  at the IP Level. Also the talk propose some weak
                  defenses for DoS. For example, check IP address of
                  Control Packet against Local Group List can help
                  corruption of Control State, prevent Spurious
                  ReTrans, and membership change flooding. It can also
                  limit bandwidth on Local Retransmission to prevent
                  spurious retransmission request. It can also remove
                  slow receivers to help refusal to ACK packets, and
                  spurious retransmission request. Anther defense is
                  to use IP multicast defenses such sa pruning. This
                  can deal with the problem of improperly scoped
                  packet, or faster senders }

                  which continues to explode in size as ecommerce and
                  related activities grow. The heterogeneous and
                  largely unregulated structure of the Internet
                  renders tasks such as dynamic routing, optimized
                  service provision, service level veri.cation, and
                  detection of anomalous/malicious behavior extremely
                  challenging. The problem is compounded by the fact
                  that one cannot rely on the cooperation of
                  individual servers and routers to aid in the
                  collection of network traffic measurements vital for
                  these tasks. In many ways, network monitoring and
                  inference problems bear a strong resemblance to
                  other inverse problems in which key aspects of a
                  system are not directly observable. Familiar signal
                  processing or statistical problems such as
                  tomographic image reconstruction and phylogenetic
                  tree identi.cation have interesting connections to
                  those arising in networking. This article introduces
                  network tomography, a new field which we believe will
                  benefit greatly from the wealth of statistical theory
                  and algorithms. It focuses especially on recent
                  developments in the field including the application

                  Range Dependence of Internet Packet Traffic},
  institution =  {Bell Labs},
  year =     2002,
  note =     {As the number of active connections (NAC) on an
                  Internet link increases, the long-range dependence
                  of packet traffic changes due to increased
                  statistical multiplexing of packets from different
                  connections. Four packet traffic variables are
                  studied as time series --- inter-arrival times,
                  sizes, packet counts in 100 ms intervals, and byte
                  counts in 100 ms intervals. Results are based on the
                  following: (1) the mathematical theory of marked
                  point processes; (2) empirical study of 2526 packet
                  traces, 5 min or 90 sec in duration, from 6 Internet
                  monitors measuring 15 interfaces ranging from 100
                  mbps to 622 mbps; (3) simple statistical models for
                  the traffic variables; and (4) network simulation
                  with NS. All variables have components of long-range
                  dependence at all levels of the NAC. But the
                  variances of the long-range dependent components of
                  the sizes and of the inter-arrivals decrease to zero
                  as the NAC increases; the sizes tend toward
                  independent, and the inter-arrivals tend toward
                  independent or very short range dependent. These
                  changes in the sizes and inter-arrivals are not
                  arrested by the increased upstream queueing that
                  eventually occurs as the NAC increases. The
                  long-range dependence of the count variables does
                  not change with the NAC, but their standard
                  deviations relative to the means decrease like one
                  over the square root of the NAC, making the counts
                  smooth relative to the mean. Theory suggests that
                  once the NAC is large enough, increased upstream
                  queueing should alter these properties of the
                  counts, but in the empirical study and in the
                  simulation study the NAC was not large enough to
                  observe an alteration for 100 ms counts. The change
                  in the long-range dependence of the sizes and
                  inter-arrivals does not contradict the constancy of
                  the long-range dependence of the counts because the
                  summation operations that produce counts from the
                  arrivals and sizes act on an increasing number of
                  packets as the NAC increases. },

                  application requirements, investigating the
                  properties of a cell-based wireless communications

                  such as PDAs and cellular telephones operate as thin
                  clients within a larger infrastructure. To access
                  services within their local environment, these
                  devices participate in a service discovery protocol
                  which involves a master directory that registers all
                  services available in the local environment. These
                  directories typically are isolated from each
                  other. Devices that move across service discovery
                  domains have no access to information outside their
                  current local domain. In this paper we propose an
                  application-level protocol called VIA that enables
                  data sharing among discovery domains. Each directory
                  maintains a table of active links to other
                  directories that share related information. A set of
                  linked directories forms a data cluster that can be
                  queried by devices for information. The data cluster
                  is distributed, self-organizing, responsive to data
                  mobility, and robust to failures. Using
                  application-defined data schemas, clusters organize
                  themselves into a hierarchy for efficient querying
                  and network resource usage. Through analysis and
                  simulation we describe the behavior of VIA under
                  different workloads and show that the protocol
                  overhead for both maintaining a cluster and handling
                  failures grows slowly with the number of gateways. *

  crossref =     "mobicom00",
  abstract =     {Caching frequently accessed data items on the client
                  side is an effective technique to improve
                  performance in a mobile environment. Classical cache
                  invalidation strategies are not suitable for mobile
                  environments due to the disconnection and mobility
                  of the mobile clients. One attractive cache
                  invalidation technique is based on invalidation
                  reports (IRs). However, the IR-based cache
                  invalidation solution has two major drawbacks, which
                  have not been addressed in previous research. First,
                  there is a long query latency associated with this
                  solution since a client cannot answer the query
                  until the next IR interval. Second, when the server
                  updates a hot data item, all clients have to query
                  the server and get the data from the server
                  separately, which wastes a large amount of
                  bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an IR-based
                  cache invalidation algorithm which can significantly
                  reduce the query latency and efficiently utilize the
                  broadcast bandwidth. Detailed simulation experiments
                  are carried out to evaluate the proposed
                  methodology. Compared to previous IR-based schemes,
                  our scheme can significantly improve the throughput
                  and reduce the query latency, the number of uplink
                  request, and the broadcast bandwidth requirements. }

                  cannot be trusted, seems to imply more mechanism in

                  used to collect detailed IP traffic measurements
                  from an IP backbone. Usage, i.e, bytes transmitted,
                  is determined from raw NetFlow records generated by
                  the backbone routers. The amount of raw data is
                  immense. Two types of data sampling in order to
                  manage data volumes: (i) (packet) sampled NetFlow in
                  the routers; (ii) sizedependent sampling of NetFlow
                  records. Furthermore, dropping of NetFlow records in
                  transmission can be regarded as an uncontrolled form
                  of sampling. We show how to manage the trade-off
                  between estimation accuracy and data
                  volume. Firstly, we describe the sampling error that
                  arises from all three types of sampling when
                  estimating usage per traffic class: how it can be
                  predicted from models and raw data, and how it can
                  be estimated directly from the sampled data
                  itself. Secondly, we show how to determined the
                  usage of resources, computational cycle,
                  storage within the components of the
                  infrastructure. These two sets of methods allow
                  dimensioning of the measurement infrastructure in
                  order to meet accuracy goals for usage estimation.}

                  distributions. This make them poor candidates for
                  uniform sampling, i.e. selecting in flows since
                  omission or inclusion of a large flow can have a
                  large effect on estimated total traffic. Flows
                  selected in this manner are thus unsuitable for use
                  in usage sensitive billing. We propose instead using
                  a size-dependent sampling scheme which gives
                  priority to the larger contributions to customer
                  usage. This turns the heavy tails to our advantage;
                  we can obtain accurate estimates of customer usage
                  from a relatively small number of important
                  samples. The sampling scheme allows us to control
                  error when charging is sensitive to estimated usage
                  only above a given base level. A refinement allows
                  us to strictly limit the chance that a customers
                  estimated usage will exceed their actual
                  usage. Furthermore, we show that a secondary goal,
                  that of controlling the rate at which samples are
                  produced, can be fulfilled provided the billing
                  cycle is sufficiently long. All these claims are
                  supported by experiments on flow traces gathered
                  from a commercial network.}

  abstract =     {In this paper we introduce power control as a
                  solution to the multiple access problem in
                  contention-based wireless ad-hoc networks. The
                  motivation for this study is two fold, limiting
                  multi-user interference to increase singlehop
                  throughput, and reducing power consumption to
                  increase battery life. We focus on next neighbor
                  transmissions where nodes are required to send
                  information packets to their respective receivers
                  subject to a constraint on the
                  signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. The multiple
                  access problem is solved via two alternating phases,
                  namely scheduling and power control. The scheduling
                  algorithm is essential to coordinate the
                  transmissions of independent users in order to
                  eliminate strong interference
                  (e.g. selfinterference) that can not be overcome by
                  power control. On the other hand, power control is
                  executed in a distributed fashion to determine the
                  admissible power vector, if one exists, that can be
                  used by the scheduled users to satisfy their
                  single-hop transmission requirements. This is done
                  for two types of networks, namely TDMA and TDMA/CDMA
                  wireless ad-hoc networks.},

  crossref =     "mobicom00",
  abstract =     {In a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network,
                  multiple mobile hosts (MHs) can simultaneously
                  transmit over the wireless channel by using
                  different codes. To assure an acceptable quality of
                  service for all users' flows, the network usually
                  tunes the transmit powers of all MHs to achieve a
                  certain level of signal strength as compared to the
                  noise and the interference (SINR) for each user. The
                  traditional assumption in power control schemes is
                  that the SINR requirement is statically determined
                  for each user flow. In contrast, in this paper, we
                  propose a scheme that dynamically adapts the SINR
                  requirements of user flows based on its quality of
                  service (QoS) requirements and the conditions of the
                  wireless channel between the MHs and the base
                  station. As a result of this adaptation, we show
                  that network-level QoS measures such as fraction of
                  packets meeting their delay requirements and energy
                  consumed per packet transmission are significantly
                  better than in a scheme that statically fixes the
                  SINR requirements. Our scheme uses a simple
                  table-driven approach for optimally selecting the
                  target SINR requirement for each MH at run time. The
                  entries in the table are computed offline using a
                  dynamic programming algorithm with the objective of
                  maximizing a profit function that balances the need
                  for meeting the network-level QoS requirements and
                  the cost of using a particular target SINR for a
                  given transmission. }

  abstract =     {The emphasis on processors that are both low-power
                  and high-performance has resulted in the
                  incorporation of dynamic voltage scaling into
                  processor designs. This feature allows one to make
                  fine granularity trade-offs between power use and
                  performance, provided there is a mechanism in the OS
                  to control that trade-off. In this paper, we
                  describe a novel software approach to automatically
                  controlling dynamic performance and voltage scaling
                  to optimize energy use. Our mechanism is implemented
                  in the Linux kernel and requires no modification of
                  user programs. Unlike previous automated approaches,
                  our method works equally well with irregular and
                  multiprogrammed workloads. Moreover, it has the
                  ability to ensure that the quality of interactive
                  performance is within user specified parameters. Our
                  experiments show that as a result of our algorithm,
                  processor energy savings of as much as 75\% can be
                  achieved with only a minimal impact on the user

  abstract =     {MERIT is a framework to assess routing protocols in
                  mobile ad hoc networks (manets). It is based on the
                  concept of shortest mobile path (SMP) in a mobile
                  graph. As a standard measure for routing protocols
                  in a manet, the MERIT framework proposes the mean
                  ratio of the cost of the actually used route to the
                  cost of the optimal mobile path, under the same
                  history of link metrics in the changing network
                  topology. This MEan Real vs. Ideal cosT (MERIT)
                  ratio is unifying in that it provides a measure that
                  allows a protocol to be assessed independently of
                  other protocols, within its own framework. We show
                  that there is an efficient algorithm to solve the
                  underlying SMP problem for important cases, making
                  the approach practically feasible. We also
                  investigate generalizations and extensions within
                  the MERIT framework.}

                  initiate route discovery only AFTER a path breaks,
                  incurring a significant cost in detecting the
                  disconnection and establishing a new route. In this
                  work, we investigate adding preemptive route
                  maintenance to on-demand ad-hoc routing
                  algorithms. More specifically, when a path is likely
                  to be broken, a warning is sent to the source
                  indicating the likelihood of a disconnection. The
                  source can then initiate path discovery early,
                  potentially avoiding the disconnection altogether. A
                  path is considered likely to break when the received
                  packet power becomes close to the minimum detectable
                  power (other approaches are possible). Care must be
                  taken to avoid initiating false route warnings due
                  to fluctuations in received power caused by fading,
                  multipath effects and other transient
                  phenomena. Experiments demonstrate that adding
                  preemptive route selection and maintenance to DSR
                  and AODV (on-demand ad hoc routing protocols)
                  significantly reduces the number of broken paths,
                  with a small increase in the number of control
                  packets generated. Packet latency and jitter are
                  also reduced. Pro-active route selection and
                  maintenance is general and can be used with other
                  routing algorithms and optimizations to them.}

                  Using a Moving Target},
  crossref =     {ipsn04},
  abstract =     {We describe a novel method for node localization in
                  a sensor network where there are a fraction of
                  reference nodes with known locations. For
                  application-specific sensor networks, we argue that
                  it makes sense to treat localization through online
                  distributed learning and integrate it with an
                  application task such as target tracking. We propose
                  distributed online algorithm in which sensor nodes
                  use geometric constraints induced by both radio con-
                  nectivity and sensing to decrease the uncertainty of
                  their position. The sensing constraints, which are
                  caused by a commonly sensed moving target, are
                  usually tighter than connectivity based constraints
                  and lead to a decrease in average localization error
                  over time. Different sensing models, such as radial
                  binary detection and distance-bound estimation, are
                  considered. First, we demonstrate our approach by
                  studying a simple scenario in which a moving beacon
                  broadcasts its own coordinates to the nodes in its
                  vicinity. We then generalize this to the case when
                  instead of a beacon, there is a moving target with
                  a-priori unknown coordinates. The algorithms
                  presented are fully distributed and assume only
                  local information exchange between neighboring
                  nodes. Our results indicate that the proposed method
                  can be used to significantly enhance the accuracy in
                  position estimation, even when the fraction of
                  reference nodes is small. We compare the efficiency of
                  the distributed algorithms to the case when node
                  positions are estimated using centralized (convex)
                  programming. Finally, simulations using the
                  TinyOS-Nido platform are used to study the
                  performance in more realistic scenarios.}

                  obtained by combining sensing materials with
                  integrated circuitry, are being considered for
                  several biomedical applications such as a retina
                  prosthesis. These devices require the capability to
                  communicate with an external diagnostic computer
                  system via a wireless interface. The limited power
                  and computational capabilities of smart sensor based
                  biological implants present research challenges in
                  several aspects of wireless networking due to the
                  need for having a bio-compatible, fault-tolerant,
                  energy-efficient, and scalable design. Further,
                  embedding these sensors in humans add additional
                  requirements. For example, the wireless networking
                  solutions should be ultra-safe and reliable, work
                  trouble-free in different geographical locations
                  (although implants are not expected to move; they
                  shouldn't restrict movements of their human host),
                  and require minimal maintenance. This necessitates
                  application-specific solutions which are vastly
                  different from traditional solutions. In this paper,
                  we describe the challenges for wireless networking
                  of human-embedded smart sensor arrays and our
                  preliminary approach for wireless networking of a
                  retina prosthesis. Our aim is to motivate vigorous
                  research in this area by illustrating the need for
                  more application-specific and novel approaches
                  toward developing wireless networking solutions for
                  human-embeddable smart sensors.},

  crossref =     "mobicom00",
  abstract =     {An on-demand routing protocol for wireless ad hoc
                  networks is one that searches for and attempts to
                  discover a route to some destination node only when
                  a sending node originates a data packet addressed to
                  that node. In order to avoid the need for such a
                  route discovery to be performed before each data
                  packet sent, an on-demand routing protocol must
                  cache routes previously discovered. Such caching,
                  however, introduces the problem of proper strategies
                  for managing the cache as nodes in the network move
                  in and out of wireless transmission range of one
                  another, possibly invalidating some cached routing
                  information and producing additional overhead and
                  dropped packets as some nodes attempt to use this
                  information for packets that they send or
                  forward. This paper presents an analysis of the
                  effects of different design choices for this caching
                  in on-demand routing protocols in wireless ad hoc
                  networks, dividing the problem into choices of cache
                  structure, cache capacity, and cache timeout. Our
                  analysis is based on the Dynamic Source Routing
                  protocol (DSR), which operates entirely
                  on-demand. Using detailed simulations of wireless ad
                  hoc networks of 50 mobile nodes, we studied a total
                  of 10 different caching algorithms that utilized a
                  range of design choices, and simulated each
                  algorithm over a set of 50 different movement
                  scenarios drawn from 5 different types of mobility
                  patterns. We also define a set of new mobility
                  metrics that allow accurate characterization of the
                  relative difficulty that a given movement scenario
                  presents to an ad hoc network routing protocol, and
                  we analyze each mobility metric's ability to predict
                  the actual difficulty in terms of routing overhead
                  experienced by the routing protocol across all
                  scenarios in our study. }

                  tasks are readily available to end consumers. For
                  example, mobile users can retrieve Web content using
                  handheld devices since content retrieval is
                  well-supported by infrastructure services such as
                  transformational proxies. However, the same type of
                  support is lacking for input-centric devices, those
                  that create content and allow users to share
                  content. This lack of infrastructural support makes
                  input-centric devices hard to use and less
                  useful. The Appliance Data Services project seeks to
                  explore a vision of an appliance computing world
                  where users move data seamlessly among various
                  devices. Based on this vision, we formulate three
                  principles that guide the design of an architecture
                  that helps realize this vision: bring devices to the
                  forefront, minimize the number of device features,
                  and place functionality in the network
                  infrastructure. We evaluate our implementation of
                  the ADS architecture based on these principles, and
                  build applications using the ADS framework to
                  evaluate the ease with which appliance computing
                  applications can be built using the framework. We
                  find that it is relatively simple to build and
                  extend applications on ADS that make using digital
                  devices easier, and results in the devices
                  themselves becoming more useful.}

                  wireless networks. We compare through simulations
                  the performance of the two network models in terms
                  of raw network capacity, end-to-end throughput,
                  end-to-end delay, power consumption, per-node
                  fairness (for throughput, delay, and power), and
                  impact of mobility on the network performance. The
                  simulation results show that while ad-hoc networks
                  perform better in terms of throughput, delay, and
                  power, they suffer from unfairness and poor network

                  them, and argue that the trade-offs preclude the

  crossref =     "mobicom01",
  abstract =     {Wireless local area networks are becoming
                  increasingly popular, due, in part, to the recent
                  availability of devices capable of communicating at
                  high data rates. These high rates are made possible,
                  in part, through new modulation techniques that
                  dramatically increase bandwidth efficiency. However,
                  the appropriate modulation scheme is a function of
                  the channel conditions. Consequently, wireless
                  devices often support multiple data rates utilizing
                  multiple modulation schemes, and provide users the
                  ability to manually choose the desired rate. A rate
                  adaption mechanism may also be employed, which
                  automatically selects the rate that gives the
                  optimum throughput for the channel
                  conditions. Although rate adaption techniques for
                  cellular wireless networks have been studied at
                  length, few have been proposed for wireless local
                  area networks. This paper presents one such
                  mechanism: a rate adaptive MAC protocol based on the
                  RTS/CTS protocol, called the Receiver-Based AutoRate
                  (RBAR) protocol. In RBAR, the rate adaption
                  mechanism is located on the receiver, instead of on
                  the sender (as is the case in current devices like
                  the WaveLAN~II. This configuration is better because
                  it allows the rate adaption mechanism to acquire
                  channel quality information directly from the
                  receiver's hardware, resulting in more efficient
                  channel quality estimation. Simulation results of an
                  implementation of RBAR into IEEE~802.11 show that
                  this arrangement performs well.}

                  milliseconds (ms), depending on the tolerance level
                  of the individual. Contributors to delay include
                  normal processing in a network, the distance between
                  two communicating points, network congestion, and
                  packet loss and retransmission delays. To
                  successfully deploy toll-quality voice services over
                  packet infrastructures, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^service
                  providers must engineer their networks in a way that
                  ensures that latency does not exceed the 200 ms
                  end-to-end, one-way maximum. To accommodate a wider
                  scope of users, keeping latency below 100 ms is
                  preferable. Packet loss should remain under 3
                  percent, with 1 percent packet discard preferable. }

  abstract =     {This paper analyzes two analytical mobility models
                  for their suitability to handover modeling and to
                  the estimation of signaling cost. Some
                  insufficiencies of the often employed Hong/Rappaport
                  model are detected. Here, an infinite mean dwell
                  time occurs which is not suitable for performance
                  evaluation of mobile communications
                  systems. Therefore, handover modeling is not
                  possible. To prevent infinite dwell times, an
                  universal condition for the velocity distribution is
                  derived. The biased sampling formula of the velocity
                  distribution fulfills our universal
                  condition. Finally, the consequences of the biased
                  sampling of the velocity for the signaling traffic
                  are discussed for the modified Hong/Rappaport model
                  and a highway model. In contrast to the analytical
                  calculations without consideration of biased
                  sampling, we detect a significant increase of
                  signaling traffic. It is shown that the probability
                  density function of the velocity of the
                  boundary-crossing subscribers is given by the biased
                  sampling formula. Thus, for handover modeling and
                  the exact estimation of signaling traffic the biased
                  sampling formula of the velocity has to be taken
                  into account in analytical calculations in any
                  case. }

                  wireless networks, unlike current generation voice
                  networks. This opens up new and interesting
                  problems. Physical and link layer issues have been
                  studied extensively and standardized. On the other
                  hand, resource allocation and scheduling issues have
                  not been addressed satisfactorily. In this work, we
                  address resource management on the downlink of CDMA
                  packet data networks. Network performance (for
                  example, capacity) has been addressed, but user
                  centric performance has not received much
                  attention. Recently, various non-traditional
                  scheduling schemes based on new metrics have been
                  proposed, and target user performance (mostly
                  without reference to wireless). We adapt these
                  metrics to the CDMA context, and establish some new
                  results for the offline scheduling problem. In
                  addition, we modify a large class of online
                  algorithms to work in our setup and conduct a wide
                  range of experiments. Based on detailed simulations,
                  we infer that: 1. Algorithms which exploit ``request
                  sizes'' seem to outperform those that do not. Among
                  these, algorithms that also exploit channel
                  conditions provide significantly higher network
                  throughput. 2. Depending on continuous or
                  discretized bandwidth conditions, either pure time
                  multiplexing or a combination of time and code
                  multiplexing strikes an excellent balance between
                  user satisfaction and network
                  performance. 3. Discrete bandwidth conditions can
                  lead to degraded user level performance without much
                  impact on network peformance. We argue that the
                  discretization can be tuned to address this
                  shortcoming. }

  abstract =     {We present Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing
                  (GPSR), a novel routing protocol for wireless
                  datagram networks that uses the positions of routers
                  and a packet's destination to make packet forwarding
                  decisions. GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions
                  using only information about a router's immediate
                  neighbors in the network topology. When a packet
                  reaches a region where greedy forwarding is
                  impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing around
                  the perimeter of the region. By keeping state only
                  about the local topology, GPSR scales better in
                  per-router state than shortest- path and ad-hoc
                  routing protocols as the number of network
                  destinations increases. Under mobility's frequent
                  topology changes, GPSR can use local topology
                  information to find correct new routes quickly. We
                  describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive
                  simulation of mobile wireless networks to compare
                  its performance with that of Dynamic Source
                  Routing. Our simulations demonstrate GPSR's

                  multi-hop wireless networks requires support from
                  both medium access and packet scheduling
                  algorithms. However, due to the distributed nature
                  of ad hoc networks, nodes may not be able to
                  determine the next packet that would be transmitted
                  in a (hypothetical) centralized and ideal dynamic
                  priority scheduler. In this paper, we develop two
                  mechanisms for QoS communication in multi-hop
                  wireless networks. First, we devise distributed
                  priority scheduling, a technique that piggybacks the
                  priority tag of a node's head-of-line packet onto
                  handshake and data packets; e.g., RTS/DATA packets
                  in IEEE 802.11. By monitoring transmitted packets,
                  each node maintains a scheduling table which is used
                  to assess the node's priority level relative to
                  other nodes. We then incorporate this scheduling
                  table into existing IEEE 802.11 priority back-off
                  schemes to approximate the idealized
                  schedule. Second, we observe that congestion, link
                  errors, and the random nature of medium access
                  prohibit an exact realization of the ideal
                  schedule. Consequently, we devise a scheduling
                  scheme termed multi-hop coordination so that
                  downstream nodes can increase a packet's relative
                  priority to make up for excessive delays incurred
                  upstream. We next develop a simple analytical model
                  to quantitatively explore these two mechanisms. In
                  the former case, we study the impact of the
                  probability of overhearing another packet's priority
                  index on the scheme's ability to achieve the ideal
                  schedule. In the latter case, we explore the role of
                  multi-hop coordination in increasing the probability
                  that a packet satisfies its end-to-end QoS
                  target. Finally, we perform a set of ns-2
                  simulations to study the scheme's performance under
                  more realistic conditions.}

  crossref =     "mobicom01",
  abstract =     {Mobile systems must adapt their behavior to changing
                  network conditions. To do this, they must accurately
                  estimate available network capacity. Producing
                  quality estimates is challenging because network
                  observations are noisy, particularly in mobile, ad
                  hoc networks. Current systems depend on simple,
                  exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)
                  filters. These filters are either able to detect
                  true changes quickly or to mask observed noise and
                  transients, but cannot do both. In this paper, we
                  present four filters designed to react quickly to
                  persistent changes while tolerating transient
                  noise. Such filters are agile when possible, but
                  stable when necessary, adapting their behavior to
                  prevailing conditions. These filters are evaluated
                  in a variety of networking situations, including
                  persistent and transient change, congestion, and
                  topology changes. We find that one filter, based on
                  techniques from statistical process control,
                  provides performance superior to the other
                  three. Compared to two EWMA filters, one agile and
                  the other stable, it is able to offer the agility of
                  the former in four of five scenarios and the
                  stability of the latter in three of four scenarios.},

                  1-dimensional marginal distribution of traffic
                  increments of aggregate TCP-traffic satisfy the
                  hypothesis of approximate normality. Gaussian
                  approximation requires a high level of aggregation
                  in both vertical (source aggregation) and
                  horizontal (time scale) directions. We discuss
                  these different concepts of aggregation first
                  separately, with an example from real data traffic,
                  and show how to rule out cases where the level of
                  aggregation will not be sufficient. Gaussian
                  approximation is then quantified with the square of
                  the linear correlation coefficient in
                  normal-quantile plots. We propose an elementary
                  method based on this correlation test, by looking at
                  the behavior of the test statistic for different
                  sample sizes, and show positive and negative
                  examples from the example data. We use this method
                  to look for the first time scale, where the Gaussian
                  approximation is plausible with the example data,
                  and then we look how much more vertical
                  aggregationwould be needed for smaller time scales
                  in order to obtain a reasonable approximation by
                  normal distribution.}

  crossref =     "mobicom01",
  abstract =     {With the increasing popularity of mobile computing
                  devices, the need to access information in mobile
                  environments has grown rapidly. Since the
                  information has to be accessed over wireless
                  networks, mobile information systems often have to
                  deal with problems like low bandwidth, high delay,
                  and frequent disconnections. Information hoarding is
                  a method that tries to overcome these problems by
                  transferring information, which the user will
                  probably need, in advance. The hoarding mechanism
                  that we describe in this paper exploits the location
                  dependence of the information access, which is often
                  found in mobile information systems. Our simulation
                  results show that it is beneficial to do so and that
                  we achieve higher hit ratios than with a caching
                  mechanism.}

  abstract =     {This paper examines the latency in Internet path
                  failure, failover and repair due to the convergence
                  properties of inter-domain routing. Unlike switches
                  in the public telephony network which exhibit
                  failover on the order of milliseconds, our
                  experimental measurements show that inter-domain
                  routers in the packet switched Internet may take
                  tens of minutes to reach a consistent view of the
                  network topology after a fault. These delays stem
                  from temporary routing table oscillations formed
                  during the operation of the BGP path selection
                  process on Internet backbone routers. During these
                  periods of delayed convergence, we show that
                  end-to-end Internet paths will experience
                  intermittent loss of connectivity, as well as
                  increased packet loss and latency. We present a
                  two-year study of Internet routing convergence
                  through the experimental instrumentation of key
                  portions of the Internet infrastructure, including
                  both passive data collection and fault-injection
                  machines at major Internet exchange points. Based on
                  data from the injection and measurement of several
                  hundred thousand inter-domain routing faults, we
                  describe several unexpected properties of
                  convergence and show that the measured upper bound
                  on Internet inter-domain routing convergence delay
                  is an order of magnitude slower than previously
                  thought. Our analysis also shows that the upper
                  theoretic computational bound on the number of
                  router states and control messages exchanged during
                  the process of BGP convergence is factorial with
                  respect to the number of autonomous systems in the
                  Internet. Finally, we demonstrate that much of the
                  observed convergence delay stems from specific
                  router vendor implementation decisions and ambiguity
                  in the BGP specification. },

  crossref =     "mobicom01",
  abstract =     {Early simulation experience with wireless ad hoc
                  networks suggests that their capacity can be
                  surprisingly low, due to the requirement that nodes
                  forward each others' packets. The actual capacity is
                  a function of the total number of nodes in the
                  network, the traffic patterns, and the detailed
                  local radio interactions. This paper examines these
                  factors alone and in combination, using simulation
                  and analysis from first principles. The results
                  include both general scaling relationships and
                  specific constants helpful in understanding ad hoc
                  simulations and in guiding deployment of ad hoc
                  systems. The most significant result of this work is
                  that the traffic pattern is the deciding factor in
                  whether an ad hoc network's per node capacity will
                  scale with the number of nodes in the net. If most
                  communication is localized, the total network
                  bandwidth available to each node stays roughly
                  constant regardless of total network size. Non-local
                  patterns, on the other hand, result in a decrease in
                  per node bandwidth as the total number of nodes
                  grows. Thus the question ``Are large ad hoc networks
                  feasible?'' boils down to a question about the
                  likely locality of communication in such networks.},

  abstract =     {Geographic forwarding could form the foundation for
                  large scale, ad hoc, mobile networks, but it is
                  impractical without a similarly scalable means of
                  determining destination locations. This paper
                  presents a distributed location service (DLS) which
                  fills this need while preserving the decentralized
                  advantages of ad hoc networks. The DLS we present
                  has the following desirable properties. It uses only
                  the mobile nodes of the ad hoc network, with no
                  fixed infrastructure. The resources (CPU time,
                  messages exchanged, and storage) each node
                  contributes to the location service are proportional
                  to the log of the total number of nodes and are
                  spread evenly amongst the nodes. Queries for the
                  locations of nearby nodes are satisfied with
                  correspondingly local communication. Finally, the
                  failure of any single node affects the location
                  database service for only a handful of other
                  nodes. In our DLS, each node maintains a set of
                  location servers which it keeps up to date with its
                  current location. A node sends updates to its
                  location servers without knowing their actual
                  identities, assisted by a predefined ordering of
                  node identifiers and a predefined spatial
                  hierarchy. Similarly, location queries may be routed
                  to a node's location servers without knowing their
                  identities, using the same predefined network
                  relationships. The only lower-level network service
                  the DLS needs is geographic forwarding. This paper
                  explains how the distributed location service works,

                  properties, and presents simulation results

                  criteria are generally in conflict in a

                  hosts upon a wireless network interface. Previous
                  research in this area has concentrated on routing
                  algorithms which are designed for fully connected
                  networks. The usual way to deal with a disconnected
                  ad-hoc network is to let the mobile computer wait
                  the network reconnection passively, which may lead
                  to unacceptable transmission delays. In this paper,
                  we propose an approach that guarantees message
                  transmission in minimal time. In this approach,
                  mobile hosts actively modify their trajectories to
                  transmit messages. We develop algorithms that
                  minimize these modifications under two different
                  assumptions: (a) the movements of all the nodes in
                  the system and known and (b) the movements of the
                  hosts in the system are not known.}

                  Low-Bandwidth Links},
  crossref =     "mobicom00",
  abstract =     {Compressing protocol headers has traditionally been
                  an attractive way of conserving bandwidth over
                  low-speed links, including those in wireless
                  systems. However, despite the growth in recent years
                  in the number of end-to-end protocols beyond TCP/IP,
                  header compression deployment for these protocols
                  has not kept pace. This is in large part due to
                  complexities in implementation, which often requires
                  a detailed knowledge of kernel internals, and a lack
                  of a common way of pursuing the general problem
                  across a variety of end-to-end protocols. To address
                  this, rather than defining several new
                  protocol-specific standards, we present a unified
                  framework for header compression. This framework
                  includes a simple, platform-independent header
                  description language that protocol implementors can
                  use to describe high-level header properties, and a
                  platform-specific code generation tool that produces
                  kernel source code automatically from this header
                  specification. Together, the high-level description
                  language and code generator free protocol designers
                  from having to understand any details of the target
                  platform, enabling them to implement header
                  compression with relatively little effort. We
                  analyze the performance of compression produced
                  using this framework for TCP/IP in the Linux 2.0
                  kernel and demonstrate that unified,
                  automatically-generated header compression without
                  significant performance penalty is viable. }

  abstract =     {TCP Westwood (TCPW) is a sender-side modification of
                  the TCP congestion window algorithm that improves
                  upon the performance of TCP Reno in wireline as well
                  as wireless networks. The improvement is most
                  significant in wireless networks with lossy links,
                  since TCP Westwood relies on end-to-end bandwidth
                  estimation to discriminate the cause of packet loss
                  (congestion or wireless channel effect) which is a
                  major problem in TCP Reno. An important
                  distinguishing feature of TCP Westwood with respect
                  to previous wireless TCP extensions is that it does
                  not require inspection and/or interception of TCP
                  packets at intermediate (proxy) nodes. Rather, it
                  fully complies with the end-to-end TCP design
                  principle. The key innovative idea is to
                  continuously measure at the TCP source the rate of
                  the connection by monitoring the rate of returning
                  ACKs. The estimate is then used to compute
                  congestion window and slow start threshold after a
                  congestion episode, that is, after three duplicate
                  acknowledgments or after a timeout. The rationale of
                  this strategy is simple: in contrast with TCP Reno,
                  which blindly halves the congestion window after
                  three duplicate ACKs, TCP Westwood attempts to
                  select a slow start threshold and a congestion
                  window which are consistent with the effective
                  bandwidth used at the time congestion is
                  experienced. We call this mechanism faster
                  recovery. The proposed mechanism is particularly
                  effective over wireless links where sporadic losses
                  due to radio channel problems are often
                  misinterpreted as a symptom of congestion by current
                  TCP schemes and thus lead to an unnecessary window
                  reduction. Experimental studies reveal improvements
                  in throughput and performance, as well as in
                  fairness. In addition, friendliness with TCP Reno
                  was observed in a set of experiments showing that
                  TCP Reno connections are not starved by new coming
                  TCPW connections. Most importantly, TCPW is
                  extremely effective in mixed wired and wireless
                  networks where throughput improvements of up to
                  550\% are observed. Finally, TCPW performs almost as
                  well as localized link layer approaches such as the
                  popular Snoop scheme, without incurring the O/H of a
                  specialized link layer protocol.}

                  throughput in an ad hoc network in the presence of
                  nodes that agree to forward packets but fail to do
                  so. To mitigate this problem, we propose
                  categorizing nodes based upon their dynamically
                  measured behavior. We use a watchdog that identifies
                  misbehaving nodes and a pathrater that helps routing
                  protocols avoid these nodes. Through simulation we
                  evaluate watchdog and pathrater using packet
                  throughput, percentage of overhead (routing)
                  transmissions, and the accuracy of misbehaving node
                  detection. When used together in a network with
                  moderate mobility, the two techniques increase
                  throughput by 16\% in the presence of 40\%
                  misbehaving nodes, while increasing the percentage
                  of overhead transmissions from the standard routing
                  protocol's 8\% to 16\%. During extreme mobility,
                  watchdog and pathrater can increase network
                  throughput by 30\%, while increasing the overhead

                  negotiate the SA parameters, and the receiver
                  decides the SPI. For IP Multicast, who make the
                  decision: this paper propose either the sender or
                  some other service providers, e.g. Key
                  Server. Whichever provides the SPI and SA
                  parameters, receivers use (SrcAddr, SPI, Protcol)
                  tuple to identify the SA. There are 4 advantages:
                  1. it works for 1-m, which is the IP multicast
                  application demands; 2. current IPSec implementation
                  will not need to be changed. Access SA Database
                  (SAD) will not change 3. Some multicast protocol
                  will only admit the creation of 1-m multicast groups
                  (PIMv2), this provides sender-authentication
                  4. IPSec anti-replay feature can be used because
                  different sender's packet will not be mixed. But
                  frankly, I do not agree with the point of view in
                  this paper. First, consider the 1-m case, in this
                  case, why do we want to use source address,
                  destination address will do the same job, no pint to
                  change the IPSec. Second, in the m-m case, in this
                  case, using source address will make selecting SPI
                  easier because each source can select their own SPI,
                  the above approach provides a distributed selection
                  possible, they may select the same SPI, however, if
                  we think they use the same parameter, the parameter
                  will have to be passed to the senders, we need a
                  central control point anyway, why bother let each
                  sender to select SPI. }

                  fundamental problem in wireless sensor

  note =     {In MacKie-Mason and Varian (1994a) we proposed a way
                  to price network usage that we called smart
                  markets. Much of the time the network is
                  uncongested; at such times the price for usage
                  should be zero. However, when the network is
                  congested, packets are queued, delayed, and
                  dropped. The current queuing scheme is FIFO.We
                  propose instead that packets should be prioritized
                  based on the value that the user puts on getting the
                  packet through quickly. To do this, each user
                  assigns her packets a bid measuring her
                  willingness-to-pay for immediate servicing. At
                  congested routers, packets are prioritized based on
                  bids. In order to make the scheme
                  incentive-compatible, users are not charged the
                  price they bid, but rather are charged the bid of
                  the highest priority packet that is not admitted to
                  the network. It can be shown that this mechanism
                  provides the right incentives for users to reveal
                  their true priority.},

                  mobile users with uncertain parameters is developed
                  in this paper. Such uncertainty arises naturally in
                  wireless networks, since an efficient user tracking
                  is based on a prediction of its future call and
                  mobility parameters. The conventional approach based
                  on dynamic tracking is not reliable in the sense
                  that inaccurate prediction of the user mobility
                  parameters may significantly reduce the tracking
                  efficiency. Unfortunately, such uncertainty is
                  likely to be expected for mobile users, especially
                  for bursty mobility pattern. In this study we
                  propose a novel approach, which is efficient yet
                  reliable. The basic idea is to incorporate a
                  distributed scheme with a centralized scheme. The
                  location update process incorporates a
                  topology-independent distance based strategy and a
                  load-sensitive timer. This combination forms a
                  mechanism that bounds from above the total tracking
                  cost. The registration activity is governed by the
                  system, such that it increases at lowly loaded cells
                  and decreases at heavily loaded cells. The expected
                  wireless cost of tracking under the proposed method
                  is significantly reduced, in comparison to the
                  existing methods currently used in cellular
                  networks. Furthermore, as opposed to other tracking
                  methods, the worst case tracking cost is bounded
                  from above and governed by the system. The proposed
                  strategy can be easily implemented, and it does not
                  require a significant computational power from the
                  user. }

                  for wireline and packet cellular networks cannot be
                  generalized for shared channel wireless networks
                  because of the unique characteristics of the
                  wireless channel, such as location-dependent
                  contention, inherent conflict between optimizing
                  channel utilization and achieving fairness, and the
                  absence of any centralized control. In this paper,
                  we propose a general analytical framework that
                  captures the unique characteristics of shared
                  wireless channels and allows the modeling of a large
                  class of system-wide fairness models via the
                  specification of per-flow utility functions. We show
                  system-wide fairness can be achieved without
                  explicit global coordination so long as each node
                  executes a contention resolution algorithm that is
                  designed to optimize its local utility function. We
                  present a general mechanism for translating a given
                  fairness model in our framework into a corresponding
                  per-node backoff-based collision resolution
                  algorithm. Using this translation, we derive the
                  backoff algorithm for achieving proportional
                  fairness in wireless shared channels, and compare
                  the performance of this algorithm with both the
                  ideal proportional fairness objective, and
                  state-of-the-art backoff-based contention resolution
                  algorithms from related literature. We believe that
                  the two aspects of the proposed framework, i.e. the

                  performance across periods of minutes can mask out
                  performance degradation due to short-lived events,
                  such as micro-congestion episodes, that manifest
                  themselves at smaller time scales. In this paper we
                  perform a mea- surement study of packet traces
                  collected inside the Sprint IP network to identify
                  the time scales over which micro- congestion

                  respect to their amplitude, frequency and
                  duration. We dene a new performance metric that
                  could be easily com- puted by a router and reported
                  every 5 minutes through SNMP to shed light into the
                  micro-behavior of the car- ried trac. We show that
                  the proposed performance metric is well suited to
                  track the time scales over which micro- congestion
                  episodes occur, and may be useful for a variety of

  abstract =     {PGM provides ordered, duplicate-free, multicast data
                  from multiple senders to multiple receivers.PGM has
                  no notion of group membership. It simply provides
                  reliable multicast data delivery within a transmit
                  window advanced by a source in the absence of
                  negative acknowledgments from any receiver. Reliable
                  delivery is provided within a source's transmit
                  window from the time a receiver joins the group
                  until it departs. PGM guarantees that a receiver in
                  the group either receives all data packets from
                  transmissions and retransmissions, or is able to
                  detect unrecoverable data packet loss. PGM is best
                  suited to those applications in which members may
                  join and leave at any time, and that are either
                  insensitive to unrecoverable data packet loss or are
                  prepared to resort to application recovery in the
                  event. Through its optional extensions, PGM provides
                  specific mechanisms to support applications as
                  disparate as stock and news updates, data
                  conferencing, and low-delay, real-time video
                  transfer. Summary of Operations: PGM runs over a
                  datagram multicast protocol such as IP multicast
                  [5]. In the normal course of data transfer, a source
                  multicasts sequenced data packets (ODATA), and
                  receivers unicast selective negative acknowledgments
                  (NAKs) for data packets detected to be missing from
                  the expected sequence. Network elements forward NAKs
                  PGM-hop-by-PGM-hop to the source, and confirm each
                  hop by multicasting a NAK confirmation (NCF) in
                  response on the interface on which the NAK was
                  received. Retransmissions (RDATA) may be provided
                  either by the source itself or by a Designated Local
                  Retransmitter (DLR) in response to a NAK, or by
                  another receiver in response to an NCF. \em{The
                  security considerations of PGM are}: In addition to
                  the usual problems of end-to-end authentication, PGM
                  is vulnerable to a number of security risks that are
                  specific to the mechanisms it uses to establish
                  source path state, to establish retransmit state, to
                  forward NAKs, to identify DLRs, and to distribute
                  retransmissions. These mechanisms expose PGM network
                  elements themselves to security risks since network
                  elements not only switch but also interpret SPMs,
                  NAKs, NCFs, and RDATA, all of which may legitimately
                  be transmitted by PGM sources, receivers, and
                  DLRs. Short of full authen- tication of all
                  neighboring sources, receivers, DLRs, and network
                  ele- ments, the protocol is not impervious to
                  abuse. So putting aside the problems of rogue PGM
                  network elements for the moment, there are enough
                  potential security risks to network elements
                  associated with sources, receivers, and DLRs
                  alone. These risks include denial of service through
                  the exhausting of both CPU bandwidth and memory, as
                  well as loss of (retransmit) data connectivity
                  through the muddling of retransmit state. False SPMs
                  may cause PGM network elements to mis-direct NAKs
                  intended for the legitimate source with the result
                  that the requested RDATA would not be
                  forthcoming. False NAKs may cause PGM network
                  elements to establish spurious retransmit state that
                  will expire only upon time-out and could lead to
                  memory exhaustion in the meantime. False NCFs may
                  cause PGM network elements to suspend NAK forwarding
                  prematurely (or to mis-direct NAKs in the case of
                  redirecting NCFs) resulting eventually in loss of
                  RDATA. False RDATA may cause PGM network elements to
                  tear down legitimate retransmit state resulting
                  eventually in loss of legitimate RDATA. The
                  development of precautions for network elements to
                  protect them- selves against incidental or
                  unsophisticated versions of these attacks is work in
                  progress and includes: Damping of jitter in the
                  value of either the source NLA of SPMs or the path
                  NLA in SPMs. While the source NLA is expected to
                  change seldom, the path NLA is expected to change
                  occasionally as a conse- quence of changes in
                  underlying multicast routing information. The
                  extension of NAK shedding procedures to control the
                  volume, not just the rate, of confirmed NAKs. In
                  either case, these procedures assist network
                  elements in surviving NAK attacks at the expense of
                  maintaining service. More efficiently, network
                  elements may use the knowledge of TSIs and their
                  associated transmit windows gleaned from SPMs to
                  control the proliferation of retransmit
                  state. Matching of the source NLA of NCFs against
                  the path NLA in SPMs (or the DLR's NLA in OPT_REDIR)
                  to verify that the confirmation is at least
                  apparently coming from the expected entity. A
                  three-way handshake between network elements and
                  DLRs that would permit a network element to
                  ascertain with greater confidence that an alleged
                  DLR is in fact on the same subnet, is identified by
                  the alleged NLA, and is PGM conversant. Since PGM's
                  Local Retransmission procedures allow any receiver
                  to provide RDATA, the source NLA of RDATA may vary
                  widely in value. At the expense of the efficiencies
                  of local retransmission, a PGM net- work element
                  could reduce its vulnerability to false RDATA by
                  accept- ing RDATA only from the source, but as with
                  all of these procedures, this is still no protection
                  against full falsification of the network-layer
                  header. },

  abstract =     {This ID discuss to authenticate messages between
                  PIMv2 routers. There are 3 types of routers in a
                  PIMv2 domain: BootStrap Router (bsr), Rendezvous
                  Point Router (rp), and Designated Router (dr). The
                  author propose to use IPSec for authentication
                  between routers. The three main cases where a PIM
                  router interacts with other routers on different
                  subnets are: (1)The bootstrap router sends
                  authoritative group-to-RP mappings to all other
                  routers in the same PIM domain. If PIM routers
                  accept bootstrap messages from non-authorized
                  candidate BSRs, it can potentially disrupt multicast
                  routing for the entire PIM domain. (2)Candidate RPs
                  sending candidate RP advertisement messages to the
                  BSR. The BSR needs to avoid advertising bogus
                  group-to-RP mappings, which can lead to
                  unpredictable routing state. (3)DRs sending Register
                  messages to the RPs. The RPs need to ignore register
                  messages from unauthorized PIM sources. After
                  identifying these attacks, the authors proposed 2
                  authentication methods: (1) Equal Opportunity
                  method. All routers within the domain use the same
                  key for all PIM messages. (2) Differentiated
                  Capabilities Method. In this case, all routers
                  still share one common key. However, special efforts
                  are made to protect the first 2 attacks. (1) All BSR
                  routers share a common RSA key pairs. The public key
                  is distributed to all routers in the
                  domain. Bootstrap messages are signed using the
                  private key.(2)All RPs and BSRs share another
                  symmetric key. No other routers have this key. This
                  key is called the RP key. For candidate RP
                  advertisement the digest is only calculated with the
                  RP key, instead of the equal opportunity key. The
                  above approaches makes it easier to support very
                  large PIM domains where some PIM routers may be
                  managed by multiple operators. MY OPINION: There are
                  some problems with SPI. In this ID, the requirements
                  are: (1)When the differentiated capability method is
                  in use, separate SPIs are needed for the different
                  security associations. (2)Initialized to zero,
                  incremented by one on each subsequent PIM message
                  from the same originator. This means each receiver
                  will have to keep the SAD for destination address,
                  the IPSec replay attack mechanism may not work. It
                  is obvious bsr/rp is a subgroup of all PIM routers
                  will higher privilege. Therefore, it can be make
                  $K_all = H(K_bsr/rp)$, this can save the rp/bsr some
                  works}

                  access generate bursts of activities, it is
                  important to match the performance of the wearable
                  device accordingly. This paper describes a system
                  with a microprocessor whose speed can be varied
                  (frequency scaling) as well as its input
                  voltage. Voltage scaling is important for reducing
                  power consumption to very low values when operating
                  at low speeds. Measurements show that the energy per
                  instruction at minimal speed (59 MHz) is 1/5 of the
                  energy required at full speed (251 MHz). The
                  frequency and voltage can be scaled dynamically from
                  user space in only 140 mu s. This allows power-aware
                  applications to quickly adjust the performance level
                  of the processor whenever the workload
                  changes. Experiments with an H.263 video benchmark
                  show that the power-aware decoder outperforms a
                  static fixed-frequency policy as well as a dynamic

                  through a ``software compass'' attached to a mobile
                  device enhances various applications, including
                  efficient way-finding and navigation, directional
                  service discovery, and ``augmented-reality''
                  displays. Using fixed active beacons and passive
                  position sensors, we show how to estimate the
                  orientation of a mobile device to within a few
                  degrees, using differences in distance estimates
                  from a beacon to each sensor on the compass. There
                  are two essential pieces to this capability. First,
                  we show how to arrange three or more receivers
                  precisely, a few centimeters apart on the compass,
                  so that the differential arrival time of an
                  ultrasonic carrier can be precisely estimated for
                  any pair of receivers to within the required
                  sub-centimeter accuracy. Second, given a set of
                  fixed, active position beacons whose locations are
                  known, we describe an algorithm that combines
                  several carrier arrival times to produce a robust
                  estimate of the rigid orientation of the mobile
                  compass. Our physical sensor configuration involves
                  five passive ultrasonic receivers, each 0.8cm in
                  diameter, arrayed in a ``V'' shape several
                  centimeters across. Using multiple beacons
                  distributed throughout a building, each broadcasting
                  coupled 418MHz RF packet data and a 40KHz ultrasound
                  carrier, we demonstrate that our techniques
                  determine compass orientation to within 3 degrees
                  when the true angle lies between plus or minus 30
                  degrees, and to within 5 degrees when the true angle
                  lies between plus or minus 40 degrees, with respect
                  to a fixed beacon.}

                  are major causes for congestion in current cellular

                  the next generation wireless systems based on the
                  integration of the cellular infrastructure and
                  modern Ad-hoc relaying technologies. The new
                  architecture can efficiently balance traffic loads
                  between cells by using Ad-hoc relay stations (ARS)
                  to relay traffic from one cell to another cell

                  in the system. We evaluate the performance
                  improvement of the new architecture through analysis

                  caching is crucial to such applications. In this

                  location dependent data in mobile computing. We
                  first develop a mobility model to represent the

                  utilizes the semantic locality in terms of

                  workstation audio and the demonstration that limited

                  network with their current location in order to get
                  packets delivered. Paging facilitates efficient
                  power management at the mobile host by allowing the
                  host to update the network less frequently at the
                  cost of providing the network with only approximate
                  location information. The network determines the

                  before delivering packets destined to the mobile
                  host. In this paper, we propose the concept of
                  paging as an IP service. IP paging enables a common
                  infrastructure and protocol to support the different
                  wireless interfaces such as CDMA, GPRS, wireless
                  LAN, avoiding the duplication of several application
                  layer paging implementations and the
                  inter-operability issues that exists today. We
                  present the design, implementation, and detailed
                  qualitative and quantitative evaluation, using

                  end-to-end architecture for host mobility on the
                  Internet using dynamic updates to the Domain Name
                  System (DNS) to track network location. Existing TCP
                  connections are retained using secure and efficient
                  connection migration, enabling established
                  connections to seamlessly negotiate a change in
                  endpoint IP addresses. Our architecture is
                  secure--name updates are effected via the secure DNS
                  update protocol, while TCP connection re-addressing
                  uses a novel set of Migrate options--and provides a
                  pure end-system alternative to infrastructure-based
                  approaches such as Mobile IP. Mobile IP was designed
                  under the assumption that fixed Internet hosts and
                  applications were to remain unmodified and only the
                  underlying IP substrate should change. Our
                  architecture requires no changes to the unicast IP
                  substrate, instead modifying transport protocols and
                  applications at the end hosts. We argue that this is
                  not a hindrance to deployment; rather, in a
                  significant number of cases, it allows for an easier
                  deployment path than Mobile IP. We compare and
                  contrast the strengths of end-to-end and
                  network-layer mobility schemes, and argue that
                  end-to-end schemes are better suited to many common
                  mobile applications. Our performance experiments
                  show TCP migrate latencies are on the order of a
                  round-trip time of the communicating peers, and our
                  architecture scales as well as the DNS even if most
                  Internet hosts become mobile. }

                  for the power consumption at the system level in
                  portable devices. In this work we present the
                  time-indexed SMDP model (TISMDP) that we use to
                  derive optimal policy for DPM in portable
                  systems. TISMDP model is needed to handle the
                  non-exponential user request interarrival times we
                  observed in practice. We use our policy to control
                  power consumption on three different devices: the
                  SmartBadge portable device, Sony Vaio laptop hard

                  savings for all three devices when using our

                  consumption and performance of our algorithm and
                  compared it with other DPM algorithms for laptop
                  hard disk and WLAN card. The algorithm based on our
                  TISMDP model has $1.7$ times less power consumption
                  as compared to the default Windows timeout policy
                  for the hard disk and three times less power

                  microsensors has attracted a great deal of research
                  attention. For the most part, this is due to the
                  compelling applications that will be enabled once
                  wireless microsensor networks are in place;
                  location-sensing [Priyantha00], environmental
                  sensing [Kahn99], medical monitoring and similar
                  applications are all gaining interest. For network
                  researchers, however, wireless microsensor networks
                  pose numerous design challenges. For example, due to
                  the size of these networks, one challenge is to
                  devise an efficient method to access the sensor data
                  from nodes in the network. For applications
                  requiring long-term, robust sensing, such as
                  military reconnaissance, an even more important
                  challenge is to design wireless sensor networks that
                  have long system lifetimes and fault tolerance. This
                  challenge is especially difficult due to the
                  energy-constrained nature of the devices. In order
                  to design networks that have extremely long
                  lifetimes, we propose a physical-layer driven
                  approach to designing protocols and algorithms for
                  such networks. We first present a hardware model for
                  our wireless sensor node and then introduce the
                  design of physical-layer aware protocols,
                  algorithms, and applications that minimize energy
                  consumption of the system. Our approach can be used
                  at different levels of the hierarchy to take
                  advantage of the underlying hardware. Furthermore,
                  we also attempt to reduce energy consumption through
                  algorithm and protocol techniques that deal with the
                  non-idealities of the underlying hardware.}

  abstract =     {Wireless communication systems have become
                  increasingly common because of advances in radio and
                  embedded system technologies. In recent years, a new
                  class of applications that networks these wireless
                  devices together is evolving. A representative of
                  this class that has received considerable attention
                  from the research community is the wireless sensor
                  network. Such a sensor networks consist of numerous
                  tetherless devices that are released into the
                  environment and organize themselves in an ad-hoc
                  fashion. The goal of the network is to perform a
                  monitoring task, and knowledge the physical location
                  of the individual nodes is therefore essential. Not
                  only is this information needed for the sensor
                  network to report the location where events take
                  place, it also assists in group-querying or routing
                  traffic to a designated geographic destination and
                  provides information on physical network
                  coverage. However, equipping every node with a GPS
                  receiver is not always feasible due to possible
                  obstructions in the path of the satellite signals or
                  energy limitations in the nodes. In this paper, we
                  present a novel location discovery approach, which
                  we call AHLoS (Ad-Hoc Localization System), for
                  wireless sensor networks. Only a small fraction of
                  the nodes start with knowledge of their location and
                  the others dynamically estimate their positions via
                  a distributed algorithm. Furthermore, our algorithm
                  utilizes a new iterative multi-lateration technique,
                  such that all nodes that meet some simple
                  connectivity requirements are eventually able to
                  determine their position. We have analyzed the
                  operation of AHLoS, designed a new testbed of
                  wireless sensor nodes and verified the behavior of
                  our distributed localization technique. The results
                  obtained from the testbed are then incorporated in a
                  simulation platform to perform scalability tests and
                  evaluate the effects of error propagation.}

                  interfaces with emerging micro-sensors based on MEMS

                  environments for early childhood education. This is
                  a natural application as young children learn by
                  exploring and interacting with objects such as toys
                  in their environment. Our envisioned system would
                  enhance the education process by providing a
                  childhood learning environment that is
                  individualized to each child, adapts to the context,
                  coordinates activities of multiple children, and
                  allows continual unobtrusive evaluation of the

                  technologies for realizing this application, and
                  describe challenges arising from ad hoc distributed

                  data. First, we model the error in input parameters
                  of the location discovery process. Then, we study
                  the impact of errors on three selected applications:
                  exposure, best- and worst-case coverage, and
                  shortest path routing. Furthermore, we examine how
                  the choice of a specific objective function
                  optimized during the location discovery process
                  impacts the errors in results of different
                  applications.},

                  content and services on wireless phones and other
                  very small Internet terminals. Very small devices,
                  typically with 3-20 lines of text, provide
                  portability and other functionality while
                  sacrificing usability as Internet terminals. In
                  order to provide access on such limited hardware we
                  propose a small device web navigation model that is
                  more appropriate than the desktop computers web
                  browsing model. We introduce a middleware proxy, the
                  Navigation Engine, to facilitate the navigation
                  model by concisely displaying the Webs link (i.e.,
                  URL) structure. Because not all Web information is
                  appropriately linked, the Navigation Engine
                  incorporates data-detectors to extract bits of
                  useful information such as phone numbers and
                  addresses. In order to maximize program-data
                  composibility, multiple network-based services
                  (similar to browser plug-ins) are keyed to a links
                  attributes such as its MIME type. We have built this
                  system with an emphasis on user extensibility and we
                  describe the design and implementation as well as a
                  basic set of middleware services that we have found
                  to be particularly important.}

  abstract =     {To understand better how users take advantage of
                  wireless networks, we examine a twelve-week trace of
                  a building-wide local-area wireless network. We
                  analyze the network for overall user behavior (when
                  and how intensively people use the network and how
                  much they move around), overall network traffic and
                  load characteristics (observed throughput and
                  symmetry of incoming and outgoing traffic), and
                  traffic characteristics from a user point of view
                  (observed mix of applications and number of hosts
                  connected to by users). Amongst other results, we
                  find that users are divided into distinct
                  location-based sub-communities, each with its own
                  movement, activity, and usage characteristics. Most
                  users exploit the network for web-surfing,
                  session-oriented activities and chat-oriented
                  activities. The high number of chat-oriented
                  activities shows that many users take advantage of
                  the mobile network for for synchronous communication
                  with others. In addition to these user-specific
                  results, we find that peak throughput is usually
                  caused by a single user and application. Also, while
                  incoming traffic dominates outgoing traffic overall,
                  the opposite tends to be true during periods of peak
                  throughput, implying that significant asymmetry in
                  network capacity could be undesirable for our
                  users. While these results are only valid for this
                  local-area wireless network and user community, we
                  believe that similar environments may exhibit
                  similar behavior and trends. We hope that our
                  observations will contribute to a growing
                  understanding of mobile user behavior. }

                  computing environments. In this system, we extend
                  the conventional mail format and the server / client
                  (browser) architecture by considering the specific
                  features of wearable computing environments, i.e.,
                  full time operation, hands-free use of computer, and
                  close relationship to our daily life. A mail author
                  can specify the behavior of his/her mail by
                  embedding in the mail several commands useful in the
                  environment. A user can specify in the mail various
                  conditions as commands such as time, location of the
                  recipient, and status of various sensors to allow an
                  adaptive behavior in the mail. We also describe
                  other features to support wearable computing. }

  crossref =     "mobicom00",
  abstract =     {Fairness is an important issue when accessing a
                  shared wireless channel. With fair scheduling, it is
                  possible to allocate bandwidth in proportion to
                  weights of the packet flows sharing the
                  channel. This paper presents a fully distributed
                  algorithm for fair scheduling in a wireless LAN. The
                  algorithm can be implemented without using a
                  centralized coordinator to arbitrate medium
                  access. The proposed protocol is derived from the
                  Distributed Coordination Function in the IEEE 802.11
                  standard. Simulation results show that the proposed
                  algorithm is able to schedule transmissions such
                  that the bandwidth allocated to different flows is
                  proportional to their weights. An attractive feature
                  of the proposed approach is that it can be
                  implemented with simple modifications to the IEEE
                  802.11 standard. }

                  communicate regardless of their locations. One of
                  the most important issues is location management in

                  network operators, and geographical regions. In this
                  paper, a location tracking mechanism is introduced,
                  which consists of intersystem location updates using
                  the concept of a boundary location area (BLA) and
                  paging using the concept of a boundary location
                  register (BLR). The BLA is determined by a dynamic
                  location update policy in which the velocity and the
                  quality of service (QoS) are taken into account on a
                  per-user basis. The BLR is used to maintain the
                  records of mobile users crossing the boundary of
                  networks. This mechanism not only reduces location
                  tracking costs but also significantly decreases call
                  loss rates and average paging delays. The

                  application part (MAP) is essential to support
                  mobility when the mobile terminals roam between
                  different networks in next generation wireless
                  systems such as IMT-2000. In this paper, a new
                  signaling protocol is proposed to reduce the
                  overhead caused by mobility management, alleviating
                  network load and consumption of network
                  resources. Moreover, the new protocol effectively
                  reduces the latency of call delivery and call loss
                  rate due to crossing wireless systems with different
                  standards and signaling protocols. Instead of
                  performing location registration when a mobile user
                  arrives at the new system, the mobile user is
                  required to update its location information prior to
                  its reaching the boundary of two systems. Results in
                  this study demonstrate that the new protocol yields
                  significant benefits in terms of reducing signaling
                  costs, delays, and call loss rates.}

                  deployment, security issues become a central
                  concern. So far, the main research focus has been on
                  making sensor networks feasible and useful, and less
                  emphasis was placed on security. We design a suite
                  of security building blocks that are optimized for
                  resource-constrained environments and wireless
                  communication. SPINS has two secure building blocks:
                  SNEP and uTesla. SNEP provides the following
                  important baseline security primitives: Data
                  confidentiality, two-party data authentication, and
                  data freshness. A particularly hard problem is to
                  provide efficient broadcast authentication, which is
                  an important mechanism for sensor networks. uTesla
                  is a new protocol which provides authenticated
                  broadcast for severely resource-constrained
                  environments. We implemented the above protocols,
                  and show that they are practical even on
                  minimalistic hardware: The performance of the
                  protocol suite easily matches the data rate of our
                  network. Additionally, we demonstrate that the suite
                  can be used for building higher level protocols.}

  abstract =     {The energy usage of computer systems is becoming
                  more important, especially for battery operated
                  systems. Displays, disks, and cpus, in that order,
                  use the most energy. Reducing the energy used by
                  displays and disks has been studied elsewhere; this
                  paper considers a new method for reducing the energy
                  used by the cpu. We introduce a new metric for cpu
                  energy performance,
                  millions-of-instructions-per-joule (MIPJ). We
                  examine a class of methods to reduce MIPJ that are
                  characterized by dynamic control of system clock
                  speed by the operating system scheduler. Reducing
                  clock speed alone does not reduce MIPJ, since to do
                  the same work the system must run longer. However, a
                  number of methods are available for reducing energy
                  with reduced clock-speed, such as reducing the
                  voltage [Chandrakasan et al 1992][Horowitz 1993] or
                  using reversible [Younis and Knight 1993] or
                  adiabatic logic [Athas et al 1994]. What are the
                  right scheduling algorithms for taking advantage of
                  reduced clock-speed, especially in the presence of
                  applications demanding ever more
                  instructions-per-second? We consider several methods
                  for varying the clock speed dynamically under
                  control of the operating system, and examine the
                  performance of these methods against workstation
                  traces. The primary result is that by adjusting the
                  clock speed at a fine grain, substantial CPU energy
                  can be saved with a limited impact on performance.},

                  algorithm that reduces energy consumption in ad hoc
                  wireless networks. GAF conserves energy by
                  identifying nodes that are equivalent from a routing
                  perspective and turning off unnecessary nodes,
                  keeping a constant level of routing fidelity. GAF
                  moderates this policy using application- and
                  system-level information; nodes that source or sink
                  data remain on and intermediate nodes monitor and
                  balance energy use. GAF is independent of the
                  underlying ad hoc routing protocol; we simulate GAF
                  over unmodified AODV and DSR. Analysis and
                  simulation studies of GAF show that it can consume
                  40\% to 60\% less energy than an unmodified ad hoc
                  routing protocol. Moreover, simulations of GAF
                  suggest that network lifetime increases
                  proportionally to node density; in one example, a
                  four-fold increase in node density leads to network
                  lifetime increase for 3 to 6 times (depending on the
                  mobility pattern). More generally, GAF is an example
                  of adaptive fidelity, a technique proposed for
                  extending the lifetime of self-configuring systems
                  by exploiting redundancy to conserve energy while
                  maintaining application fidelity.}

                  Erasure code to correct packet-level transmission
                  errors.This approach to Forward Error Correction
                  (FEC) is based upon the computation of h parity
                  packets from k data packets for a total of n packets
                  such that a receiver can reconstruct the k data
                  packets out of any k of the n packets. More
                  specifically, it is characteristic of the parity
                  packets that any x of them can be used to
                  reconstruct any x of the original data packets. The
                  original k data packets are referred to as the
                  Transmission Group, and the total n packets as the
                  FEC Block. These procedures permit any combination
                  of pro-active FEC or on-demand FEC with conventional
                  ARQ within a given TSI to provide any flavour of
                  layered or integrated FEC. Pro-active FEC refers to
                  the technique of computing parity packets at
                  transmission time and transmitting them as a matter
                  of course following the data packets. Pro-active FEC
                  is recommended for providing loss recovery over
                  simplex or asymmetric multicast channels over which
                  returning retransmit requests is either impossible
                  or costly. It provides increased reliability at the
                  expense of bandwidth. On-demand FEC refers to the
                  technique of computing parity packets at
                  retransmission time and transmitting them only upon
                  demand (i.e., receiver-based loss detection and
                  retransmit request). On-demand FEC is recommended
                  for providing loss recovery of uncorrelated loss in
                  very large receiver populations in which the
                  probability of any single packet being lost is
                  substantial. It provides equivalent reliability to
                  selective NAKs (ARQ) at the expense of no more and
                  typically less bandwidth. Selective NAKs are NAKs
                  that request the retransmission of specific packets
                  by sequence number corresponding to the sequence
                  number of any data packets detected to be missing
                  from the expected sequence (conventional
                  ARQ). Selective NAKs are recommended for recovering
                  losses occurring in trailing partial transmission
                  groups. Parity NAKs are NAKs that request the
                  transmission of a specific number of parity packets
                  by count corresponding to the count of the number of
                  data packets detected to be missing from a group of
                  k data packets (on-demand FEC) }

                  use measurements to guide future actions. This is an
                  effective strategy if the quantities being measured
                  exhibit a degree of constancy: that is, in some

                  these notions to three Internet path properties:
                  loss, delay, and throughput. Our aim is to provide
                  guidance as to when assumptions of various forms of

                  forecasting (i.e. using the history to predict next

                  monitoring and management point, and lack of a clear
                  line of defense. Many of the intrusion detection
                  techniques developed on a fixed wired network are
                  not applicable in this new environment. It is a
                  challenging research problem on how to do it
                  differently and effectively. In this paper, we
                  explain what are the vulnerabilities of a wireless
                  ad hoc network, why we need intrusion detection, why
                  the current methods cannot apply directly, and what
                  are the possible mechanisms for intrusion detection
                  and response in wireless ad hoc network. }

                  statistics, and describes a technique for fitting
                  the PPBP to a given traffic stream. The PPBP is
                  shown to accurately predict the queueing performance
                  of a sample trace of aggregated Internet traffic. We
                  predict that in few years, natural growth and
                  statistical multiplexing will lead to an efficient
                  optical Internet.}
