\abstract{
RDMA is being deployed in DCNs for the benefit of ultra-low latency, high throughput and low CPU overhead in recent years. Current practice of RDMA deployment introduces the deadlock problem as it requires PFC to provide a lossless L2 network. While deadlock can be avoided by using a routing function that includes no cyclic buffer dependency, in this paper we demonstrate that for both tree based and non-tree based DCNs, reconfiguration-induced deadlock can occur during the routing reconfiguration process even if the routing functions are deadlock-free. 
 
Deadlock-free routing reconfiguration can be ensured by simply diving the reconfiguration process into multiple static stages. However, doing this can lead to a very slow reconfiguration process as many unnecessary constraints on the ordering of configuration operations are introduced. Motivated by this, in this paper, we develop a solution for achieving fast deadlock-free routing reconfiguration. Our solution introduces much less constraints on the orderings and thus can significantly speed up the routing reconfiguration process.
