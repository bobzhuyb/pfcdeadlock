\abstract{
In recent years, RDMA is being deployed in datacenter networks for the benefit of ultra-low latency, high throughput and low CPU overhead. The deployment of RDMA introduces the deadlock problem as RDMA needs a lossless L2 network. While deadlock can be avoided by using a routing function that do not have cyclic buffer dependency, in this paper we demonstrate that for both tree based and non-tree based datacenter networks, reconfiguration-induced deadlock can occur during the routing reconfiguration process even if the routing functions are deadlock-free. 
 
Deadlock-free routing reconfiguration can be ensured by simply diving the reconfiguration process into multiple static stages. However, doing this can lead to a very slow reconfiguration process as many unnecessary constraints on the ordering of configuration operations are introduced. To overcome this problem, we develop a solution for achieving fast deadlock-free routing reconfiguration. Our solution introduces much less constraints on the ordering of configuration operations, and thus can significantly speed up the routing reconfiguration process.
