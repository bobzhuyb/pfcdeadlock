\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}
\todo{to be added.}
In this part, we evaluate the performance of our solution via simulations.

\textbf{Topology}: 4-level Fat-tree, HyperX, Jellyfish, etc.

\textbf{Model of switch rule update}: parallel update, sequential update, etc. We also need to model the delay of control messages in our simulator.
