\para{Deadlock-free routing.} Many Deadlock-free routing designs have been
proposed. See
\cite{dally,duato93,dally93,sancho2004,flich2012survey,lash,dag,wu2003fault,glass,duato2001,domke2011,puente1999,dfedst16}
for representative schemes. Generally, these designs prevent deadlock by
imposing restrictions on the routing paths \yibo{or enforcing certain packet rerouting policies. We classify them into two
categories.}

The first category is {\em deterministic routing based approach}, in which the
routing path is not affected by the traffic status, and there is no CBD. For example, the solution proposed by Dally and Seitz~\cite{dally} split each physical channel  into a group of ordered virtual channels\footnote{A virtual channel is equivalent to a priority queue in PFC in the store-and-forward setting.}, and constructed CBD-free routing by restricting packets over decreasing order of virtual channels.
TCP-Bolt~\cite{tcpbolt} and DF-EDST~\cite{dfedst16} are two recent works under this category. They both built edge-disjoint spanning trees (EDSTs) to construct CBD-free routing paths. DF-EDST further built a deadlock-free tree transition acyclic graph, such that the transition among some EDSTs can be allowed. \revisionshuihai{These designs either work only for specific topologies \cite{dally} or are not compatible with existing routing protocols including OSPF and BGP \cite{tcpbolt,dfedst16}.}

\revisionshuihai{ The second category is {\em adaptive routing based approach.} The key idea is to pre-install  ``escape'' paths at the switches to cover all possible
destinations. The switches can reroute packets to the ``escape'' paths in the
presence of congestion so that deadlock can be avoided. However, no commodity switching ASICs so far support the dynamic rerouting based on traffic / queue status required by the adaptive routing designs. Furthermore, a certain amount of buffer needs to be reserved at the switches for the use of pre-installed ``escape'' paths.}

%Generally, solutions under this category can achieve better network utilization, as they can tolerate CBD in the routing paths.

%\textcolor{blue}{The above routing designs cannot meet our requirements for three reasons. First, they are not compatible with existing routing protocols including OSFP and BGP. Second, existing L3 routing protocols do not guarantee that packets will follow the pre-constructed paths (e.g., EDSTs), especially upon link failures. Third, some of them cannot be implemented in current commodity switching ASICs. For example, as far as we know, no commodity switching ASIC supports the dynamic rerouting based on traffic / queue status required by the adaptive routing designs.}

\para{Intel Omni-Path.} Intel Omni-Path architecture \cite{omnipath} uses the
concept of Service Channels (SC) for routing deadlock avoidance.  Unlike
\sysname{}, Ommi-path uses a centralized fabric manager to manage the
network~\cite{omnipath}, including setting up SCs. This is not feasible at
data center scale.

%% Technical details of Omni-Path are not currently available, Tagger differs
%% from Omni-Path in two significant ways. First, Omni-path needs a fabric
%% manager to dynamically setup SC whereas the tag match-action rules are
%% pre-computed and statically configured. Second, Tagger enforces that
%% the tag of a packet increases monotonically whereas Omni-Path does not
%% enforce order for SC.

\para{Buffer management for deadlock prevention.} It has been shown that by
increasing the packet priority hop-by-hop, and putting packets of different
priority into different buffers, deadlock can be avoided
\cite{firstpaper,survey,datanetworks,karol2003prevention}. \revisionshuihai{These designs,
however, need a large number of lossless queues, which is the longest path
length in the network.}

%In \cite{dag}, the author tried to reduce the number of lossless
%queues to only two. The design does not guarantee losslessness. Furthermore,
%some switches need much larger buffer space than the others.


\revisionshuihai{ \para{Deadlock detection and recovery.}  The solutions under this category~\cite{isca95,shpiner2016unlocking,venkatramani1996,martinez1997,Lopez1998} mainly include two steps. First, employing a heuristic mechanism to detect suspected deadlocks, e.g., monitoring the throughput and queue occupancy of each switch port. Second, recovering deadlock by dropping or temporarily rerouting some of the packets involved in the deadlock. The main problem with these solutions is that they do not resolve the root cause of the detected deadlock, and hence cannot prevent the reappearing of the same deadlock.  }

%\para{Deadlock recovery.} Deadlock recovery schemes \cite{isca95,shpiner2016unlocking,venkatramani1996,martinez1997,Lopez1998} detect deadlocks once they occur, and then try to break them by rerouting packets.  These approaches have two issues: (1) They cannot guarantee that deadlock will not happen again (if they can, there will be no need for deadlock recovery). (2) They cannot be deployed using existing switch hardware.

%% need to add new deadlock detection algorithms and deadlock
%% breaking protocols into the switches.

%\para{Circuit switching-based approaches.} Those solutions from HPC and InfiniBand
%work by preemption. This does not work in Ethernet and in practice.

\para{Deadlock-free routing reconfiguration.}
Several schemes
\cite{automatic,lysne2005,doublescheme,gara2005} have been proposed for
ensuring deadlock-free during routing reconfiguration. \sysname{} can
be used to help any routing protocol to be deadlock-free, as
\sysname{} is decoupled from the routing protocols.


%The basic idea is to divide the reconfiguration process into multiple
%stages, and guarantee deadlock-free routing within each stage. We
%believe
%\sysname{} can be easily modified to guarantee deadlock-free of each
%reconfiguration stage.

\modified{
\para{Summary.} \sysname{} is different from prior work. \sysname{}'s innovations are its ELP concept, and the algorithms that pre-generate the static tagging rules and minimize the number of priority classes. As a result, \sysname{} works with any routing protocol, and with existing hardware. }

%
%%support EDST.
%%Furthermore, these designs need many EDSTs and
%%every EDST needs to occupy a lossless queue.
%%Current switching ASIC,
%%however, can only support 2-3 lossless queues.

%pre-install  ``escape'' paths at every switch to cover all possible
%destinations. The switches can reroute packets to the ``escape'' paths in the
%presence of congestion so that deadlock can be avoided.  As far as we know, no
%commodity switching ASIC supports dynamic reroute based on traffic / queue
%status.


%We believe that deciding the priority of packets along the path is
%better than changing routing configurations.

%Deadlock-free routing \cite{dally,duato93,dally93,sancho2004,flich2012survey,lash,wu2003fault,glass,duato2001,domke2011,puente1999} can be achieved by splitting the physical links into virtual channels and virtual channels are arranged in a way so as to avoid circular buffer dependency. In all those designs, the routing is decided by the virtual channels. Hence they cannot work with existing routing protocols for the data center networks which was designed for the lossy networks.

%%TCP-Bolt~\cite{tcpbolt} uses multiple edge-disjoint spanning trees (EDSTs) and puts every EDST into a separate VLAN and lossless queue to achieve deadlock-free. In addition to the above drawbacks, to achieve good performance, TCP-Bolt may need a large number of lossless queues (which cannot be provided in current commodity switches). Furthermore, TCP-Bolt needs to run layer-2 VLAN, whereas all large-scale data center networks run layer-3.
%
%%DF-EDST~\cite{dfedst16} introduces a set of edge-disjoint spanning trees and a tree transition graph to provide deadlock free routing for arbitrary data center network topologies. DF-EDST, however, cannot work with existing routing protocols as it needs to follow the EDSTs. Furthermore, The EDST selection and transition cannot be readily implemented in current Ethernet switches.
