\begin{abstract} Remote Direct Memory Access over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)
		deployments are vulnerable to deadlocks induced by Priority Flow Control
		(PFC).  Prior solutions for deadlock prevention either require
		significant changes to routing protocols, or require excessive buffers
		in the switches. In this paper, we propose \sysname{}, a scheme for deadlock
		prevention. It does not require any changes to the
		routing protocol, and needs only modest buffers.  \sysname{} is based on
		the insight that given a set of expected lossless routes, a simple
		tagging scheme can be developed to ensure that no deadlock will occur
		under any failure conditions. \jitu{Packets that do not travel on these
		lossless routes may be dropped under extreme conditions.}
		We design such a scheme, prove that it prevents deadlock and implement
it efficiently on commodity hardware.  \end{abstract}
