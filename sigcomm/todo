One interesting observation: when I looked at figure 7, my first feeling is that why it always choose C for tag 1? It should choose A and B as well by symmetry. 
Then I realized that we have total 30 solutions (C_6^2) instead of 3 solutions. So it may be worth noting that figure 7 just show one of the solutions.
