\para{RoCE and the need for PFC.}
Here we emphasize that (at least current) RoCE cannot work well without PFC.
The results in DCQCN and RDMA at scale (SIGCOMM'16) paper show packet drops
are very harmful for RoCE performance.

We may add a note saying that PFC has its fundamental advantage (e.g., no retransmission),
if we could make it work well in practice, using PFC would be the right approach
for RoCE. Our paper is trying to make this happen.

\para{Circuit switching-based approaches.} Those solutions from HPC and InfiniBand
work by preemption. This does not work in Ethernet and in practice.

\para{Brute-force buffer layering solutions.} They use a lot of lossless queues. No one
has discussed how they can be implemented in reality.

\para{Summary: our differences.}
We believe that deciding the priority of packets along the path is better than changing 
routing configuratoins.
