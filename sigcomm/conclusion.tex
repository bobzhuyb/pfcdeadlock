\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented \sysname{}  for deadlock prevention in data center
networks. By carrying tags in the packets and installing pregenerated
match-action rules in the switches for tag manipulation and buffer
management, \sysname{}  guarantees deadlock-free. \sysname{} decouples
itself from routing protocols by introducing the expected lossless path
(ELP) concept, hence it works well with any existing routing protocol,
distributed or centralized. \sysname{}  works for general network
topologies. We further showed that \sysname{}  achieves optimality for
the well-known fat-tree, in terms of the number of lossless queues and
the number of match-action rules. \sysname{}  can be implemented using
existing commodity switching ASICs and is readily deployable.
