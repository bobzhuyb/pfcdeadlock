\begin{abstract} Remote Direct Memory Access over Ethernet (RoCE) deployments
		are vulnerable to deadlocks induced by Priority Flow Control (PFC).
		Prior solutions for deadlock prevention either require significant
		changes to routing protocols, or require excessive buffers in the
		switches. In this paper, we propose a scheme for deadlock prevention,
		called \sysname{} that does not require any changes to the routing
		protocol, and needs only modest buffers.  \sysname{} is based on the
		insight that given a set of expected lossless routes, a simple tagging
		scheme can be developed to ensure that no deadlock will occur under any
		failure conditions. We design such a scheme, prove that it prevents
		deadlock and implement it efficiently on commodity hardware.
\end{abstract}
