\begin{abstract} Remote Direct Memory Access over Ethernet (RoCE) deployments
		are vulnerable to deadlocks induced by Priority Flow Control (PFC).
		While several solutions for preventing deadlocks have been proposed,
		none have been widely deployed because they either require significant
		changes to routing protocols, or require excessive buffers in the
		switches. In this paper, we propose a scheme for dealdock prevention,
		called \sysname{}. \sysname{} does not require any changes to the
		routing protocol, and needs only modest buffers. 
		\sysname{} is based on the insight that once all expected lossless
		routes are known, a simple tagging and buffer management scheme can be
		developed to prevent deadlock under all failure conditions. We show how
		to design such a scheme, prove that it prevents deadlock under all
		conditions, and show how to implement it efficiently on commodity
		hardware.
